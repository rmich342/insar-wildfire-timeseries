Function code is provided 'as-is' for implementation in Matlab following processing using the Stanford Radar Processor (i.e., assumed file naming conventions, and inclusion of elevation.dem, elevation.dem.rsc, and all SBAS .out files).


***More user-friendly version of code for implementation in a Jupyter Notebook is also provided, but needs to be updated***
